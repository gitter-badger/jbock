Pull request are welcome.

jbock strives to keep the generated code minimal.
If possible, new features should not increase the generated code.
Compile time is better than runtime.

* Please respect the code style. It's basically intellij default, but with a 2-space indent and a 4-space continuation indent.
* Star-imports are not allowed.
* Automatic javadoc formatting should be turned off.
